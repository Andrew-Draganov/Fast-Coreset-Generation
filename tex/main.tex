\begin{abstract}
We study the ways of compressing a dataset of points in $\R^d$ while preserving some guarantee. For this problem, show how to implement the so called sensitivity sampling in near-linear time $\tilde O (nd)$. 
This sampling distribution ensures that the sample forms a coreset for $k$-median and $k$-means, namely, it preserves the cost with respect to any $k$-median or $k$-means solution.
We implement this algorithm and illustrates its efficiency on real-life datasets. 
In particular, it is faster than any coreset algorithm with provable guarantees, and it shows way better guarantees than uniform sampling.
%This document provides a basic paper template and submission guidelines.
%Abstracts must be a single paragraph, ideally between 4--6 sentences long.
%Gross violations will trigger corrections at the camera-ready phase.
