The results of lightweight and fast-coreset constructions on a 2D dataset of $n=100K$ points with clusters of varying size. The circled cluster has $\sim 400$
points and coresets have 200 points.
\emph{Left}: Original multivariate-Gaussian dataset.
\emph{Middle}: Lightweight coresets fail to capture the cluster of $\sim$ 400 points.
\emph{Right}: The Fast-coreset construction identifies all of the clusters.
