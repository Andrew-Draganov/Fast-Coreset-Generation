\caption{The effect of the coreset size on the distortion metric for sensitivity sampling approaches.
We point out that all distortion values are well below $\varepsilon = 0.2$.
Thus, for sufficient coreset sizes, there does not seem to be a meaningful difference between using Fast-Kmeans++ vs. regular Kmeans++.}
