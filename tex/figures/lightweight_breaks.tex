\caption{
The results of lightweight and fast-coreset constructions on a dataset of $n=100K$ points with clusters of varying size. Coresets have 200 points.
\emph{Left}: Original multivariate-Gaussian dataset. \emph{Middle}: Lightweight coresets fail to capture the cluster of $\sim$400 points.
\emph{Right}: The Fast-coreset construction runs in linear time but identifies all of the clusters.
